To come back to the moment, just press the Play icon and automatically the video will return to this moment.

All the stored Notebooks and Notes will be available to in the 'Notebooks' and 'Notes' sections. From those sections, once selected (play icon), Notebooks and Notes can be shared, just by passing the URL. However, store, edit or delete (notes and notebooks) can only be performed by the creator.
