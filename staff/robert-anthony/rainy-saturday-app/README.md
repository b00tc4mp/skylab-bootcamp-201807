# Rainy Saturday App

This application was developed as a mid-term project at Skylab Coders Academy -- development lasted one week and was based on existing registration/logic code developed in the class.

This was a group project -- I was one of three developers.  

Among other modules, I was responsible entirely for 

- ImageSearchBase.js
- SearchPage.js
- SearchForm.js
- SearchFormFilterListWithCount.js
