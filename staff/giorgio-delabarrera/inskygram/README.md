# Inskygram

Inskygram is a photo sharing social networking service.

Web application that tries to simulate the behavior of the application [Instagram](http://instagram.com). It will be developed for the presentation of the final project of the bootcamp in [Skylab Coders](https://skylabcoders.com/).


The application allows its use by registering users. The user can upload their photos and follow other users to see the photos of them.

You can also interact with your photos, those of users that follow and those of users of public profiles through likes, comments and the possibility of saving a photo as a favorite.

The search engine of the application searches for users.

Each user has a profile page where they can see their data as related to the photos (uploaded photos, saved photos).

The user can have a section where they can edit their personal data, such as activating their profile as private.
